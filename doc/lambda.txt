Syntax of lambda expression:

	exp : constant
	    | variable

	    | L variable . exp
	    .

Syntax of enriched lambda expression:

	exp : constant
	    | variable
	    | exp exp
	    | L { variable }+ . exp
	    | 'let' { def / ',' }+ 'in' exp
	    | 'letrec' { def / ',' }+ 'in' exp
	    .

	def : variable = exp .

Structured types:

	tree ::= LEAF num | BRANCH tree tree

LEAF and BRANCH are constructors and can be used as functions.
