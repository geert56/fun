	* Introduced use of general.h.
	Modified source layout to comply with my new standard.

Wed Jan 22 11:53:09 1997  Geert Janssen  <geert@cobra.ics.ele.tue.nl>

	* Added support for floating point numbers.

Thu Jan  9 15:10:46 1997  Geert Janssen  <geert@cobra.es.ele.tue.nl>

	* fun.c (mk_defrecs): Serious bug here: part of an expression got
	compiled more than once. Corrected by explicity compiling
	sub-expression and marking it before use. Also made sure to
	undefine any previous defs in a multiple defrec before the new
	ones are created.

Tue Jan  7 12:10:02 1997  Geert Janssen  <geert@cobra.es.ele.tue.nl>

	* print.c (L_print_trunc): Added this function and support for its
	functionality.

	* Reconsidered handling of interrupts during reduction. Special
	care is needed for operations like "length". Leaving the graph
	in a corrupt state should be avoided.

Sun Jan  5 22:25:00 1997  Geert Janssen  <geert@mamba.es.ele.tue.nl>

	* fun.c (fun_init): v1.3, added type syntax but no semantics yet.
